Don't be afraid to take a stab at it. Watching players actively go about gameplay and run through your game like rats in a maze is extremely gratifying to some of us. Hopefully after this, I can convince you to run a game and come out feeling like George R. R. Martin. Hopefully you don't outright murder your players, but you get what I'm saying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Typically, as a DM you want to have played at least a few sessions as a player. If you have already played, you'll recognize a lot of what is posted here. If you haven't ever played and you want to see some games played, look no further. All of the members of \"Critical Role\" are professional voice actors. Give it a go and see if you are still interested.\n",

      "Mercer is the epitome of a great DM. Emulate what he does and you'll do a great job.\n",
      "\n",
      "Editions - There are currently several editions of D&amp;D with the most up to date being 5th edition (5e). Honestly, after playing through almost all of the other editions (2nd, 3rd, 3.5, and 4th), 5e is by far the best in my opinion. Make your choice on what you want and start grabbing books.\n",
      "\n",
      "Books - This is going to require some reading on your part. Get ahold of the three core rulebooks, (Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and the Monstrous Manual) and give them a once over. If your are really serious about it and plan on becoming a DM, you need to know the same or more about the game than the players. This is going to seem like a shit load of information. Don't get overwhelmed. If you don't understand something or something seems seems too vague, don't be afraid to talk it over with your players on if it makes sense or not. These are a list of guidelines, not what you have to do. A good DM isn't afraid to admit he or she doesn't know everything. \n",
      "\n",
      "Dice - These are a necessity as well. A typical set (You're going to see these referenced an insane amount of times throughout the books) consists of a d20, d12, d10, d8, d6, and a d4. The number refers to the number of sides each has. Each of these dice has functions that are that are listed throughout the books and you will instinctively know what to use after some game time. \n",
      "\n",
      "5x5 grid - Depending on who you are talking to, some people play D&amp;D with no maps at all. These groups are rare and rely entirely on imagination and dice for encounters through description, but we're going to focus on the visual side of it. Any DM worth their salt will have a map (doesn't have to be a map just something with the intended purpose of distinguishing boxes) with a grid layout. This mainly makes up combat encounters and dungeons. Everything else falls into the realm of description on your end. Playing in person, a whiteboard or paper will work just fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figurines - Not necessary. I've seen people use scraps of paper on 5x5 grids before to assert where their characters and monsters are. This is not a rich person's game. If you want to spend some cash on some though, I recommend looking around in comic book shops first. Support your local stores and maybe you'll even draw some players in while your at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bonus - If you use Roll20.net, you don't even need to buy dice, maps, figurines, or leave your house.</p>\n",

      "<p class=\"post-image-description\" itemprop=\"description\">So over the last 15 years, I've played D&amp;D on and off as much as humanly possible. However, depending on your situation, you won't always have people constantly available to play due to constraints for work, scheduling, etc. which causes groups to fall apart fairly quickly with repeated no-shows. Sadly, it has a lot to deal with the people you're getting involved with and if they're flaky or not, but you'll never know until you play with them. My suggestion? Use Roll20.net. You can draw a lot of introverted people out of their shells when you just have mic communications. The plus side of all of this? They never even have to leave home to play. They have an entire section dedicated to finding players relevant to what you want and other peoples schedules being able to mesh with yours. Or you can always play with people you know or try comic book stores. Tons of cool people all over the place if you just give them a chance.  \n",

      "I've been using <a href=\"https://app.roll20.net\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://app.roll20.net</a> since before they officially teamed up with D&amp;D (That's right, I'm a D&amp;D hipster) and can say that it is a fantastic site for a budding, bushy tailed, bright eyed starters as well as long time, jaded, meta-gaming players. Again, this is going to require some learning on the DM's part, mainly because it is going to be you setting all of the maps and plot line up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pro tip about flakes - replace them as soon as humanly possible. Groups tend to fall flat when people go missing. I have a three strike rule. If people don't show up for that many sessions in a row and get new people in the door to keep things fresh. Don't let your world and the players who enjoy it miss out because of one bad apple.</p>\n",

      "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_campaign_settings\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_campaign_settings</a> . Not all of these settings are up to date, so keep in mind that you may have to do some converting to your edition if you decide to use these.\n",
      "\n",
      "World building has been an integral part of D&amp;D from day one. As a brand new DM, my suggestion to you is to take a shot at it. Just keep some things in mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "To start, you can make any kind of world you want. Don't let other people's sterotypes on how typical worlds should be prevent you from making a world where Orcs are the main characters and Humans are evil tyrants. If you have a story to tell, make it happen. If you want to follow a sterotypical save the princess story, go for it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Magic - I've run across DM's who had completely eradicated magic from their games to others where it was considered abnormal if you didn't have some sort of innate talent for it. Another interesting one was only divine magic (think godly powers) was the only magic. It all depends on how you want to make your world. Just keep in mind whenever you do things like this that you limit the players in a sense of what they can and cannot play.\n",
      "\n",
      "History / Kingdoms - Budding worlds make for interesting games, especially if the world in question is vastly unexplored. You can continually make your world larger and larger this way without fear of crowding taking place or being expected to have sections of your world premade. It is much easier to direct players and corral their interests with this method.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deities - Not all worlds need gods, but you can almost bet that there will be some sort of religion. If you want to make a completely atheistic world, not a problem. If you create one with deities in it, be prepared to have some sort of dogma or religious explanation, especially if you have clerics or paladins in your group. You can also use the pre-generated deities in the books if you don't want to dabble in the religious sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cities / Ruling Class - Again, don't be afraid to break some rules here and there. Some of the most fun and exciting campaign settings I've run across have been completely outside the box. Want to make a city entirely ruled and inhabited by the dead where the living are considered \"fresh meat\"? Been there, done that and it was a blast.\n",
      "\n",
      "NPCs - (Non-Player Characters) encompass every single person or creature that the players will come across from a mouse to a Ancient Red Dragon. Be sure to have a purpose for your most pertinent NPCs. Do yourself a favor and make a list of names on the side that you can just throw around if players are seeking names of characters you haven't made yet. Helps a ton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Story - I've seen games where the players are just dust floating around. They don't end well. You want to create a story that pulls the players in and keeps them glued to their seats. A game where the players have a purpose is one they will try their damnedest to fulfill (normally anyways, sometimes you'll have rebels that will fight you every step of the way) . If you see that the players are becoming bored, try to spice it up with twists and turns. Rome wasn't built in a day. You will have sessions that make you go, \"What the hell was I thinking\", or \"I didn't think the players were going to murder the king\", and make you completely reevaluate what you had planned out. That's the beauty of the game though. When players surprise you (They will, you can't plan for everything), don't be afraid to reward them for their efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maps - There is a few map making tools out there for dungeons and worlds alike that don't require you to pick up a single sheet of paper. If you want to make something on paper, make some copies. That piece of paper will get screwed up at some point by a handsy player or get magically lost. You will be devastated. Here are a few sites to get you started.\n",

I'm talking about their character classes and races. Typically as a DM, you want to have a group that is mixed around to perform different functions for everyone to benefit by. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO THIS. I've seen groups of six wizards that do wonders and skate by everything. If your group can make it work, let them give it a shot. If they all die to a massive rolling boulder, you can always rub it in that maybe one of them should have been a rogue to see the trap.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most important thing here is that the players are doing what THEY want to do. Don't force people into roles they don't want to be in. You can find tons of people who are 100% willing to play anything the group needs. Make sure that they're having fun and you'll share it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Player Deaths and Re-rolling - It happens. Don't be afraid to tell a player that heir halfling was just digested by that ooze. At lower levels, this is pretty much the definition of a player saying goodbye to their character. As players gain levels, you'll start to see them develop a feel for each other's capabilities and take care of each other more. Not all groups I've been with have done this, but most. The more games you host, you'll notice that player death's start to become rarer the higher they go as well. If it does take place, they try to resurrect that player by any means necessary as well. Don't be afraid of killing players. You are supposed to be 100% neutral in everything that occurs. Player deaths are supposed to constantly make them feel vulnerable and let them know that death lurks around every corner. \n",

Don't be afraid to take a stab at it. Watching players actively go about gameplay and run through your game like rats in a maze is extremely gratifying to some of us. Hopefully after this, I can convince you to run a game and come out feeling like George R. R. Martin. Hopefully you don't outright murder your players, but you get what I'm saying.\\n\\nTypically, as a DM you want to have played at least a few sessions as a player. If you have already played, you'll recognize a lot of what is posted here. If you haven't ever played and you want to see some games played, look no further. All of the members of \\\"Critical Role\\\" are professional voice actors. Give it a go and see if you are still interested.\\n\\nhttps:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=i-p9lWIhcLQ&list=PLqTT_VuffgDP0I6accl0jP5p3kxBRPVPa \\n\\nMercer is the epitome of a great DM. Emulate what he does and you'll do a great job.\\n\\nEditions - There are currently several editions of D&D with the most up to date being 5th edition (5e). Honestly, after playing through almost all of the other editions (2nd, 3rd, 3.5, and 4th), 5e is by far the best in my opinion. Make your choice on what you want and start grabbing books.\\n\\nBooks - This is going to require some reading on your part. Get ahold of the three core rulebooks, (Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and the Monstrous Manual) and give them a once over. If your are really serious about it and plan on becoming a DM, you need to know the same or more about the game than the players. This is going to seem like a shit load of information. Don't get overwhelmed. If you don't understand something or something seems seems too vague, don't be afraid to talk it over with your players on if it makes sense or not. These are a list of guidelines, not what you have to do. A good DM isn't afraid to admit he or she doesn't know everything. \\n\\nDice - These are a necessity as well. A typical set (You're going to see these referenced an insane amount of times throughout the books) consists of a d20, d12, d10, d8, d6, and a d4. The number refers to the number of sides each has. Each of these dice has functions that are that are listed throughout the books and you will instinctively know what to use after some game time. \\n\\n5x5 grid - Depending on who you are talking to, some people play D&D with no maps at all. These groups are rare and rely entirely on imagination and dice for encounters through description, but we're going to focus on the visual side of it. Any DM worth their salt will have a map (doesn't have to be a map just something with the intended purpose of distinguishing boxes) with a grid layout. This mainly makes up combat encounters and dungeons. Everything else falls into the realm of description on your end. Playing in person, a whiteboard or paper will work just fine.\\n\\nFigurines - Not necessary. I've seen people use scraps of paper on 5x5 grids before to assert where their characters and monsters are. This is not a rich person's game. If you want to spend some cash on some though, I recommend looking around in comic book shops first. Support your local stores and maybe you'll even draw some players in while your at it.\\n\\nBonus - If you use Roll20.net, you don't even need to buy dice, maps, figurines, or leave your house.\",\"width\":846,\"height\":455,\"size\":656085,\"ext\":\".png\",\"animated\":false,\"prefer_video\":false,\"looping\":false,\"datetime\":\"2016-09-15 00:45:16\"},{\"hash\":\"WSvgZzk\",\"title\":\"Where do I Find Players?\",\"description\":\"So over the last 15 years, I've played D&D on and off as much as humanly possible. However, depending on your situation, you won't always have people constantly available to play due to constraints for work, scheduling, etc. which causes groups to fall apart fairly quickly with repeated no-shows. Sadly, it has a lot to deal with the people you're getting involved with and if they're flaky or not, but you'll never know until you play with them. My suggestion? Use Roll20.net. You can draw a lot of introverted people out of their shells when you just have mic communications. The plus side of all of this? They never even have to leave home to play. They have an entire section dedicated to finding players relevant to what you want and other peoples schedules being able to mesh with yours. Or you can always play with people you know or try comic book stores. Tons of cool people all over the place if you just give them a chance.  \\n\\nI've been using https:\\/\\/app.roll20.net since before they officially teamed up with D&D (That's right, I'm a D&D hipster) and can say that it is a fantastic site for a budding, bushy tailed, bright eyed starters as well as long time, jaded, meta-gaming players. Again, this is going to require some learning on the DM's part, mainly because it is going to be you setting all of the maps and plot line up.\\n\\nPro tip about flakes - replace them as soon as humanly possible. Groups tend to fall flat when people go missing. I have a three strike rule. If people don't show up for that many sessions in a row and get new people in the door to keep things fresh. Don't let your world and the players who enjoy it miss out because of one bad apple.\",\"width\":450,\"height\":212,\"size\":24954,\"ext\":\".png\",\"animated\":false,\"prefer_video\":false,\"looping\":false,\"datetime\":\"2016-09-15 00:49:53\"},{\"hash\":\"2eH8FqD\",\"title\":\"Where And When Does My Campaign Take Place?\",\"description\":\"If you don't want to make your own world, consider using these campaign settings created by D&D.\\nhttps:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_campaign_settings . Not all of these settings are up to date, so keep in mind that you may have to do some converting to your edition if you decide to use these.\\n\\nWorld building has been an integral part of D&D from day one. As a brand new DM, my suggestion to you is to take a shot at it. Just keep some things in mind.\\n\\nTo start, you can make any kind of world you want. Don't let other people's sterotypes on how typical worlds should be prevent you from making a world where Orcs are the main characters and Humans are evil tyrants. If you have a story to tell, make it happen. If you want to follow a sterotypical save the princess story, go for it. \\n\\nMagic - I've run across DM's who had completely eradicated magic from their games to others where it was considered abnormal if you didn't have some sort of innate talent for it. Another interesting one was only divine magic (think godly powers) was the only magic. It all depends on how you want to make your world. Just keep in mind whenever you do things like this that you limit the players in a sense of what they can and cannot play.\\n\\nHistory \\/ Kingdoms - Budding worlds make for interesting games, especially if the world in question is vastly unexplored. You can continually make your world larger and larger this way without fear of crowding taking place or being expected to have sections of your world premade. It is much easier to direct players and corral their interests with this method.\\n\\nDeities - Not all worlds need gods, but you can almost bet that there will be some sort of religion. If you want to make a completely atheistic world, not a problem. If you create one with deities in it, be prepared to have some sort of dogma or religious explanation, especially if you have clerics or paladins in your group. You can also use the pre-generated deities in the books if you don't want to dabble in the religious sector.\\n\\nCities \\/ Ruling Class - Again, don't be afraid to break some rules here and there. Some of the most fun and exciting campaign settings I've run across have been completely outside the box. Want to make a city entirely ruled and inhabited by the dead where the living are considered \\\"fresh meat\\\"? Been there, done that and it was a blast.\\n\\nNPCs - (Non-Player Characters) encompass every single person or creature that the players will come across from a mouse to a Ancient Red Dragon. Be sure to have a purpose for your most pertinent NPCs. Do yourself a favor and make a list of names on the side that you can just throw around if players are seeking names of characters you haven't made yet. Helps a ton.\\n\\nStory - I've seen games where the players are just dust floating around. They don't end well. You want to create a story that pulls the players in and keeps them glued to their seats. A game where the players have a purpose is one they will try their damnedest to fulfill (normally anyways, sometimes you'll have rebels that will fight you every step of the way) . If you see that the players are becoming bored, try to spice it up with twists and turns. Rome wasn't built in a day. You will have sessions that make you go, \\\"What the hell was I thinking\\\", or \\\"I didn't think the players were going to murder the king\\\", and make you completely reevaluate what you had planned out. That's the beauty of the game though. When players surprise you (They will, you can't plan for everything), don't be afraid to reward them for their efforts.\\n\\nMaps - There is a few map making tools out there for dungeons and worlds alike that don't require you to pick up a single sheet of paper. If you want to make something on paper, make some copies. That piece of paper will get screwed up at some point by a handsy player or get magically lost. You will be devastated. Here are a few sites to get you started.\\n\\nwww.roll20.net - Dungeons \\/ Worlds\\nhttp:\\/\\/pyromancers.com\\/dungeon-painter-online\\/ Dungeons\\nGoogle D&D maps - Premade Towns, Dungeons, World Maps\\nhttp:\\/\\/fantasynamegenerators.com\\/ World Maps (The name is deceiving)\\nhttp:\\/\\/inkarnate.com\\/ World Maps (This one is borderline professional)\\n\\nTreasure - This is always a sour point for a ton of DM's as there are very few actual ways to predict what will and won't make your players overpowered or under-powered. Players who get randomized items that have no real use to them have a tendency to be weak, where if you make players get every single item they need, tend to stomp every encounter they come across. Adjust according to what you see. Plan some items out, randomly roll others.\",\"width\":1366,\"height\":768,\"size\":194986,\"ext\":\".jpg\",\"animated\":false,\"prefer_video\":false,\"looping\":false,\"datetime\":\"2016-09-15 01:10:24\"},{\"hash\":\"AiXyeKp\",\"title\":\"The Players\",\"description\":\"Group Diversity - No, I'm not talking about gender and ethnicity of the players. I'm talking about their character classes and races. Typically as a DM, you want to have a group that is mixed around to perform different functions for everyone to benefit by. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO THIS. I've seen groups of six wizards that do wonders and skate by everything. If your group can make it work, let them give it a shot. If they all die to a massive rolling boulder, you can always rub it in that maybe one of them should have been a rogue to see the trap.\\n\\nThe most important thing here is that the players are doing what THEY want to do. Don't force people into roles they don't want to be in. You can find tons of people who are 100% willing to play anything the group needs. Make sure that they're having fun and you'll share it.\\n\\nPlayer Deaths and Re-rolling - It happens. Don't be afraid to tell a player that heir halfling was just digested by that ooze. At lower levels, this is pretty much the definition of a player saying goodbye to their character. As players gain levels, you'll start to see them develop a feel for each other's capabilities and take care of each other more. Not all groups I've been with have done this, but most. The more games you host, you'll notice that player death's start to become rarer the higher they go as well. If it does take place, they try to resurrect that player by any means necessary as well. Don't be afraid of killing players. You are supposed to be 100% neutral in everything that occurs.

Don't be afraid to take a stab at it. Watching players actively go about gameplay and run through your game like rats in a maze is extremely gratifying to some of us. Hopefully after this, I can convince you to run a game and come out feeling like George R. R. Martin. Hopefully you don't outright murder your players, but you get what I'm saying.\\n\\nTypically, as a DM you want to have played at least a few sessions as a player. If you have already played, you'll recognize a lot of what is posted here. If you haven't ever played and you want to see some games played, look no further. All of the members of \\\"Critical Role\\\" are professional voice actors. Give it a go and see if you are still interested.\\n\\nhttps:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=i-p9lWIhcLQ&list=PLqTT_VuffgDP0I6accl0jP5p3kxBRPVPa \\n\\nMercer is the epitome of a great DM. Emulate what he does and you'll do a great job.\\n\\nEditions - There are currently several editions of D&D with the most up to date being 5th edition (5e). Honestly, after playing through almost all of the other editions (2nd, 3rd, 3.5, and 4th), 5e is by far the best in my opinion. Make your choice on what you want and start grabbing books.\\n\\nBooks - This is going to require some reading on your part. Get ahold of the three core rulebooks, (Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and the Monstrous Manual) and give them a once over. If your are really serious about it and plan on becoming a DM, you need to know the same or more about the game than the players. This is going to seem like a shit load of information. Don't get overwhelmed. If you don't understand something or something seems seems too vague, don't be afraid to talk it over with your players on if it makes sense or not. These are a list of guidelines, not what you have to do. A good DM isn't afraid to admit he or she doesn't know everything. \\n\\nDice - These are a necessity as well. A typical set (You're going to see these referenced an insane amount of times throughout the books) consists of a d20, d12, d10, d8, d6, and a d4. The number refers to the number of sides each has. Each of these dice has functions that are that are listed throughout the books and you will instinctively know what to use after some game time. \\n\\n5x5 grid - Depending on who you are talking to, some people play D&D with no maps at all. These groups are rare and rely entirely on imagination and dice for encounters through description, but we're going to focus on the visual side of it. Any DM worth their salt will have a map (doesn't have to be a map just something with the intended purpose of distinguishing boxes) with a grid layout. This mainly makes up combat encounters and dungeons. Everything else falls into the realm of description on your end. Playing in person, a whiteboard or paper will work just fine.\\n\\nFigurines - Not necessary. I've seen people use scraps of paper on 5x5 grids before to assert where their characters and monsters are. This is not a rich person's game. If you want to spend some cash on some though, I recommend looking around in comic book shops first. Support your local stores and maybe you'll even draw some players in while your at it.\\n\\nBonus - If you use Roll20.net, you don't even need to buy dice, maps, figurines, or leave your house.\",\"width\":846,\"height\":455,\"size\":656085,\"ext\":\".png\",\"animated\":false,\"prefer_video\":false,\"looping\":false,\"datetime\":\"2016-09-15 00:45:16\"},{\"hash\":\"WSvgZzk\",\"title\":\"Where do I Find Players?\",\"description\":\"So over the last 15 years, I've played D&D on and off as much as humanly possible. However, depending on your situation, you won't always have people constantly available to play due to constraints for work, scheduling, etc. which causes groups to fall apart fairly quickly with repeated no-shows. Sadly, it has a lot to deal with the people you're getting involved with and if they're flaky or not, but you'll never know until you play with them. My suggestion? Use Roll20.net. You can draw a lot of introverted people out of their shells when you just have mic communications. The plus side of all of this? They never even have to leave home to play. They have an entire section dedicated to finding players relevant to what you want and other peoples schedules being able to mesh with yours. Or you can always play with people you know or try comic book stores. Tons of cool people all over the place if you just give them a chance.  \\n\\nI've been using https:\\/\\/app.roll20.net since before they officially teamed up with D&D (That's right, I'm a D&D hipster) and can say that it is a fantastic site for a budding, bushy tailed, bright eyed starters as well as long time, jaded, meta-gaming players. Again, this is going to require some learning on the DM's part, mainly because it is going to be you setting all of the maps and plot line up.\\n\\nPro tip about flakes - replace them as soon as humanly possible. Groups tend to fall flat when people go missing. I have a three strike rule. If people don't show up for that many sessions in a row and get new people in the door to keep things fresh. Don't let your world and the players who enjoy it miss out because of one bad apple.\",\"width\":450,\"height\":212,\"size\":24954,\"ext\":\".png\",\"animated\":false,\"prefer_video\":false,\"looping\":false,\"datetime\":\"2016-09-15 00:49:53\"},{\"hash\":\"2eH8FqD\",\"title\":\"Where And When Does My Campaign Take Place?\",\"description\":\"If you don't want to make your own world, consider using these campaign settings created by D&D.\\nhttps:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_campaign_settings . Not all of these settings are up to date, so keep in mind that you may have to do some converting to your edition if you decide to use these.\\n\\nWorld building has been an integral part of D&D from day one. As a brand new DM, my suggestion to you is to take a shot at it. Just keep some things in mind.\\n\\nTo start, you can make any kind of world you want. Don't let other people's sterotypes on how typical worlds should be prevent you from making a world where Orcs are the main characters and Humans are evil tyrants. If you have a story to tell, make it happen. If you want to follow a sterotypical save the princess story, go for it. \\n\\nMagic - I've run across DM's who had completely eradicated magic from their games to others where it was considered abnormal if you didn't have some sort of innate talent for it. Another interesting one was only divine magic (think godly powers) was the only magic. It all depends on how you want to make your world. Just keep in mind whenever you do things like this that you limit the players in a sense of what they can and cannot play.\\n\\nHistory \\/ Kingdoms - Budding worlds make for interesting games, especially if the world in question is vastly unexplored. You can continually make your world larger and larger this way without fear of crowding taking place or being expected to have sections of your world premade. It is much easier to direct players and corral their interests with this method.\\n\\nDeities - Not all worlds need gods, but you can almost bet that there will be some sort of religion. If you want to make a completely atheistic world, not a problem. If you create one with deities in it, be prepared to have some sort of dogma or religious explanation, especially if you have clerics or paladins in your group. You can also use the pre-generated deities in the books if you don't want to dabble in the religious sector.\\n\\nCities \\/ Ruling Class - Again, don't be afraid to break some rules here and there. Some of the most fun and exciting campaign settings I've run across have been completely outside the box. Want to make a city entirely ruled and inhabited by the dead where the living are considered \\\"fresh meat\\\"? Been there, done that and it was a blast.\\n\\nNPCs - (Non-Player Characters) encompass every single person or creature that the players will come across from a mouse to a Ancient Red Dragon. Be sure to have a purpose for your most pertinent NPCs. Do yourself a favor and make a list of names on the side that you can just throw around if players are seeking names of characters you haven't made yet. Helps a ton.\\n\\nStory - I've seen games where the players are just dust floating around. They don't end well. You want to create a story that pulls the players in and keeps them glued to their seats. A game where the players have a purpose is one they will try their damnedest to fulfill (normally anyways, sometimes you'll have rebels that will fight you every step of the way) . If you see that the players are becoming bored, try to spice it up with twists and turns. Rome wasn't built in a day. You will have sessions that make you go, \\\"What the hell was I thinking\\\", or \\\"I didn't think the players were going to murder the king\\\", and make you completely reevaluate what you had planned out. That's the beauty of the game though. When players surprise you (They will, you can't plan for everything), don't be afraid to reward them for their efforts.\\n\\nMaps - There is a few map making tools out there for dungeons and worlds alike that don't require you to pick up a single sheet of paper. If you want to make something on paper, make some copies. That piece of paper will get screwed up at some point by a handsy player or get magically lost. You will be devastated. Here are a few sites to get you started.\\n\\nwww.roll20.net - Dungeons \\/ Worlds\\nhttp:\\/\\/pyromancers.com\\/dungeon-painter-online\\/ Dungeons\\nGoogle D&D maps - Premade Towns, Dungeons, World Maps\\nhttp:\\/\\/fantasynamegenerators.com\\/ World Maps (The name is deceiving)\\nhttp:\\/\\/inkarnate.com\\/ World Maps (This one is borderline professional)\\n\\nTreasure - This is always a sour point for a ton of DM's as there are very few actual ways to predict what will and won't make your players overpowered or under-powered. Players who get randomized items that have no real use to them have a tendency to be weak, where if you make players get every single item they need, tend to stomp every encounter they come across. Adjust according to what you see. Plan some items out, randomly roll others.\",\"width\":1366,\"height\":768,\"size\":194986,\"ext\":\".jpg\",\"animated\":false,\"prefer_video\":false,\"looping\":false,\"datetime\":\"2016-09-15 01:10:24\"},{\"hash\":\"AiXyeKp\",\"title\":\"The Players\",\"description\":\"Group Diversity - No, I'm not talking about gender and ethnicity of the players. I'm talking about their character classes and races. Typically as a DM, you want to have a group that is mixed around to perform different functions for everyone to benefit by. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO THIS. I've seen groups of six wizards that do wonders and skate by everything. If your group can make it work, let them give it a shot. If they all die to a massive rolling boulder, you can always rub it in that maybe one of them should have been a rogue to see the trap.\\n\\nThe most important thing here is that the players are doing what THEY want to do. Don't force people into roles they don't want to be in. You can find tons of people who are 100% willing to play anything the group needs. Make sure that they're having fun and you'll share it.\\n\\nPlayer Deaths and Re-rolling - It happens. Don't be afraid to tell a player that heir halfling was just digested by that ooze. At lower levels, this is pretty much the definition of a player saying goodbye to their character. As players gain levels, you'll start to see them develop a feel for each other's capabilities and take care of each other more. Not all groups I've been with have done this, but most. The more games you host, you'll notice that player death's start to become rarer the higher they go as well. If it does take place, they try to resurrect that player by any means necessary as well. Don't be afraid of killing players. You are supposed to be 100% neutral in everything that occurs.
